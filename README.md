# 3D-Game-Tools
A simple game project to get back into game development and stay familiar while building tools for more often used mechanics.
The Project will be split up into different categories and done as I see the need for them.
The will be split accordingly:

## Player/Character Controls
###     Movement 
###     Actions
####        Combat
####        Interactions with resources
####        Pick up Items
###     Inventory
###     Stats

Everything Subject to change because I'm ADHD.
